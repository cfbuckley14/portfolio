				<h2>Hello, I'm Charlotte</h2>
				<p> I'm a software developer supreme in the making! I've previously worked within the Events Industry so delivering projects for clients is in my nature.<br> I'm a dog person (important information to know), I grew up in a football-mad household which inevitably meant I played football, and I really enjoy baking in my spare time.<br> If you'd like to find out more, be sure to connect with me through my <a href="#contact-me">socials</a> - I love a chin-wag!</p>

					<p>Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.</p>
